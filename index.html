            <p class="bio">
              Bosco roamed the mean streets of Franklin County in search of
              adventure, love, and fulfillment. Once he had achieved all those
              things he was captured by a person just doing their job, the dog
              warden, and then adopted by the Williams-Schwieterman household.

              <p class="project-description">
                One of Bosco's finest efforts at date, this project is ongoing
                and faces many day to day challenges that Bosco strives to
                overcome. The neighbor's dog has been determined to be a threat
                to household security and Bosco continues to try to dig a covert
                tunnel into the neighbors yard to have a friendly conversation
                about chilling the heck out.

              <p class="project-description">
                Bosco's true passion for life is best seen while patrolling the
                mean streets of the Eastmoor North community. Bosco tirelessly
                marks all trees along his perimeter checks of the neighborhood
                boundaries. He also maintains checks on the Eruv of Columbus to
                help out his Jewish comrades during the week.
